        <p>Hi there, I'm Jordan and this is my art website. I work as a web developer in Toronto but art is what I do for fun. Currently, this site only serves as a gallery for my work, however, I am planning in the future to hunt down a good print shop, stock up on prints of my work, sign them and sell them here. So have a look around and follow me on <a href="http://instagram.com/jordanalamilla" target="_blank">Instagram</a> for updates. I appreciate any interest in what I do.</p>
